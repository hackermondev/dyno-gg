# Contributing
Thanks for considering contributing!

A few rules of thumb:
* Code contributions should match the existing code style. `npm run eslint` could help you check (requires installing ESLint)
* Check with me before adding/deleting functionality (you can contact me (abalabahaha#9421) [on Discord](https://discord.gg/n2g6BQP))
* Check the dev branch to make sure someone hasn't worked on the same thing already
* Pull requests should point to the dev branch, not master
